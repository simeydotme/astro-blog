So after following the [steps to get a base character design](/character/generating-a-base) that we're happy with, it's now time to turn that into a
expression sheet! So that we can use it for the future variations and poses we want to create.

## What is an Expression Sheet?

An expression sheet is a sheet of drawings of your character, showing the different expressions they can make. This is a great way to 
get a feel for your character, and to see how they look when they're happy, sad, angry, etc. It also happens to be a great way
to give Midjourney a bunch of references for how your character should look like, going forward.

See the hero image above for an example of an expression sheet.

## Let's create one now!

For demonstration purposes I will use the [character called "April" that I created in the previous step](/character/generating-a-base#april-with-braids).
I'm choosing her because she has some pretty unique features and I like her aesthetic! But after the walkthrough, I will demonstrate 
the character sheets for all the characters I've shown in the previous step.

### Step 1: Collect your references

So providing you followed along so far, you should have either a single base reference sheet, or a couple of similar styles which you
like. These will be the base for our image-prompt. Here's my references from the previos step:

<ScrollingImages>
  <Image src={april1} alt="April, reference sheet #1" />
  <Image src={april2} alt="April, reference sheet #2" />
</ScrollingImages>

And, although these were all I showed before, I actually wanted to try out some more variations to see if I can get
more of a pink/grey hair color, and also to see how she looks with a different hairstyle. So I created these additional
references:

<ScrollingImages>
  <Image src={april3} alt="April, reference sheet #3" />
  <Image src={april4} alt="April, reference sheet #4" />
  <Image src={april5} alt="April, reference sheet #5" />
</ScrollingImages>

#### Time to build a prompt!

Now that we have these references, we will [build upon the prompt we created in the previous step](/character/generating-a-base/#april-with-braids) 
to turn it into a prompt that will generate an expression sheet for us.

<pre class="astro-code github-dark demo-prompt">
  <code>
    /imagine prompt: <span class="prompt-code">[reference1.png]</span> <span class="prompt-code">[reference2.png]</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">grid layout</span>, <span class="prompt-code">3x2</span>, <span class="prompt-code">character expression sheet</span>, 
    <span class="prompt-code">different expressions</span><span class="prompt-code">::3</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">[original prompt]</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">`--ar` 6:5</span>
  </code>
</pre>

which, when considering our April character, looks like;

<pre class="astro-code github-dark demo-prompt">
  <code>
    /imagine prompt: <span class="prompt-code">`https://s.mj.run/M6hbb1YEafU`</span> <span class="prompt-code">`https://s.mj.run/EEhlLxBbg-0`</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">grid layout</span>, <span class="prompt-code">3x2</span>, <span class="prompt-code">character expression sheet</span>, 
    <span class="prompt-code">different expressions</span><span class="prompt-code">::3</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">beautiful 26yo girl with bright green eyes, 
dark tanned skin, long purple gradient hair, chunky braid hairstyle , 
wearing a green sweater, in the style of miss nagatoro anime, 
isolated on a grey background, different expressions `--s 40 --niji`</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">`--ar` 6:5</span>
  </code>
</pre>

Let's dig into the different parts, here.

- `[reference1.png] [reference2.png]`  
  These are the references we want to use for our prompt. You can use as many as you want, but I recommend
  keeping it to 2-3. 

<Question title="Image Reference Notes">
  It's important not to put any commas between or after the image references, as that will break the prompt.
  You can [learn more about _"image prompts"_ here](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts).
</Question>

- `grid layout`  
  This is the first part of defining our expression sheet. We tell Midjourney that we want the resulting
  image to be in a grid. This helps to prevent the chaotic, random layouts that we were getting with the reference sheets.

- `3x2`  
  Next we want to try and control the size of the grid. We do this by specifying the number of rows and columns
  we want. In this case, we want 3 rows and 2 columns.

<Question title="Grid Layout Notes">
  Supplying `grid layout, 3x2` will not _**guarantee**_ that the resulting image will be
  exactly 3x2, but it will help guide Midjourney most of the time. As with all generations, it
  may take multiple tries to get it right.
</Question>

- `character expression sheet`  
  This is the main element. This will tell Midjourney to follow the format of an 
  expression sheet; meaning multiple poses/expressions _**of the same character**_.

- `different expressions`  
  Combined with the `character expression sheet` prompt, this just gives a little extra help
  to make sure we are getting multiple expressions instead of a single image repeated 6 times. It's not totally necessary,
  but it occasionally helps.

- `::3`  
  This is a special syntax to "weight" the previous section of the prompt. This will make sure the that the parts
  I just described above _(`grid layout, 3x2, character expression sheet, different expressions`)_ are given more 
  power over the image composition. If you are [unfamiliar with prompt weight / multi-promps, read here](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/multi-prompts).

- `[original prompt]`  
  This is the prompt we created in the previous step. We want to include this so that Midjourney
  will consider the original description when referencing our character reference sheets. Make sure to include the original
  parameters, too, like `--s 40 --niji`. This is important to keep the image looking the same style.

- `--ar 6:5`  
  And finally, we will change the aspect ratio to a Landscape format. Expression sheets in a 3x2 grid are what
  I've found to be easiest to expand upon, and Midjourney is more happy to create that layout with a landscape aspect ratio.

#### Enough explaining, let's see what we get!

<pre class="astro-code github-dark demo-prompt">
  <code>
    /imagine prompt: <span class="prompt-code">`https://s.mj.run/M6hbb1YEafU`</span> <span class="prompt-code">`https://s.mj.run/EEhlLxBbg-0`</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">grid layout</span>, <span class="prompt-code">3x2</span>, <span class="prompt-code">character expression sheet</span>, 
    <span class="prompt-code">different expressions</span><span class="prompt-code">::3</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">beautiful 26yo girl with bright green eyes, 
dark tanned skin, long purple gradient hair, chunky braid hairstyle , 
wearing a green sweater, in the style of miss nagatoro anime, 
isolated on a grey background, different expressions `--s 40 --niji`</span> 
    <span class="prompt-code">`--ar` 6:5</span>
  </code>
</pre>

First returned result;

<Image src={aprilSheet1} alt="April, generated character sheet #1" />

#### Now this is not bad at all!

So let's explain a couple of things here. 

##### Objective;

- ðŸ”´ Firstly the <MJ text="U1" /> image is a 3x3 grid, which is not what we're looking for.

<blockquote class="small-quote">
  This is a good example to show _**why we dont want 3x3**_. 
  
  The 3x3 has much less clothing and upper-body expression on show. 
  This limits our ability to pose hands, shoulders and accessories. Also long hair that drapes over the shoulders is
  cut off. This is why it's preferred to use a 3x2 grid.
</blockquote>

- âœ… Secondly, notice how varied the expressions are in the other images? 

<blockquote class="small-quote">
  There's a range of emotions and postures. Some side-on, some
  front-on. Some with hands, some without. This is exactly what we want to see in an expression sheet. It gives us a lot of options
  for later when we want to manipulate the expressions.
</blockquote>

- ðŸ”¶ Some heads are cut off at the top, don't worry; we will fix that later.
- âœ… The backgrounds are mostly a mid-tone grey!

##### Subjective;

- ðŸ”´ The hair color is not what the gray/pink color I hoped for.
- âœ… The hair style is cute! Lots of chunky braids.
- âœ… We're getting nice sweater details and it's a good shape.
- ðŸ”¶ The skin color is not quite as tan as I was hoping for.
- ðŸ”¶ I'm not totally fond of these eyes.

---

So based on my subjective notes, I have two options.

- `1a`: I can use a different set of references to try and get a better result.


- `1b`: I can choose one of these images, and try to replace the eyes with something I like better.

---

#### `1a`: I want it closer to my reference!

So if we feel that the reference images are not producing the kind of character we are looking for,
we can go back and choose a reference we liked, and produce a few "subtle" variations of that reference.
Then use _only_ the variations as the reference. We can provide more, too, to overpower the image weighting.

I really liked this one;

<Image src={april5} alt="April, reference sheet #5" />

So I will generate 3 more subtle variations of this image.

<ScrollingImages>
  <Image src={aprilVariation1} alt="April, reference sheet variant #1" />
  <Image src={aprilVariation2} alt="April, reference sheet variant #2" />
  <Image src={aprilVariation3} alt="April, reference sheet variant #3" />
</ScrollingImages>
